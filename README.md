This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the MediaWiki API to extract relevant text from Wikipedia articles based on user input. By entering a keyword, users can generate and refresh "blacked-out" poems from the text.

How to Use:

1. Enter a keyword.
2. Hit the search button.
3. View your blacked-out poem.
4. Refresh to see a new blacked-out poem or enter a new keyword!

Features
1. Natural Language Processing: Extracts meaningful text based on user input.
2. MediaWiki API Integration: Fetches content directly from Wikipedia articles.
3. Tkinter: Provides an easy to use GUI for interacting with the application.
